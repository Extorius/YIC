# YIC
A ChatGPT jailbreak specifically handcrafted to teach ChatGPT how jailbreaks work, how they trick ChatGPT, and how to recreate them; with the end goal of creating a jailbreak that creates other jailbreaks.

All in all, this jailbreak is very capable and can create strong jailbreaks that ChatGPT will usually fall for. Anything too far fetched like racial slurs won't work, but for the most part this jailbreak is quite useful for creating simpler jailbreaks.
